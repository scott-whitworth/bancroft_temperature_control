# tempData Files
This section is intentionally left empty as the TempData csv files need to be manually set up. This folder still needs to be here for the possible relative pathing from `bear_trap.py`

All temperatures are in degrees C as floats. These tempData files would take the form of:

```
<day number>,   <0:00 temp>, <0:30 temp>, <1:00 temp>, <1:30 temp>, ...
<day number+1>, <0:00 temp>, <0:30 temp>, <1:00 temp>, <1:30 temp>, ...
<day number+2>, <0:00 temp>, <0:30 temp>, <1:00 temp>, <1:30 temp>, ...

```
